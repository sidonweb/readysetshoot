            question: "How accurate are the sunrise and sunset forecasts?",
            answer: "Our sunrise and sunset forecasts are highly accurate, typically within 1-2 minutes of the actual times. We use precise astronomical calculations based on your exact location, taking into account atmospheric refraction and your local horizon."

            id: 2,
            question: "Is this app good for Milky Way and astro planning?",
            answer: "Absolutely! The app is specifically designed for astrophotography planning. It provides detailed information about moon phases, astronomical twilight times, light pollution levels, and optimal shooting windows for Milky Way photography."
        },
        {
            id: 3,
            question: "How often does the forecast update?",
            answer: "Weather forecasts are updated every 6 hours with the latest meteorological data. Astronomical data (sunrise, sunset, moon phases) is calculated in real-time based on your location and never needs updating as it's based on precise celestial mechanics."
        },
        {
            id: 4,
            question: "Is this just for pros or can anyone use it?",

            id: 5,
            question: "How many locations can I save?",
